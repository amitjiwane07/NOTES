npm install -g @angular/cli =  it is used to install angular
npm install -g bootstrap = used to install bootstrap
ng new hello-world = it used to create new project.
ng-serve = it is used to start application
ng-build = it is used to convert executable code which u can share with the client
Alt+ctrl+shift+T = it is used to open terminal on eclipse
ng generate component (component_name) OR ng g c (compName) == it is used to generate component

dataBinding = communication of data between templats and model classes
Oninit = when application starts it takes place, whenevwer constructor is created
directive = it allows developers to create custom html tags

template = it is used to generate HTMLcontent

Components = this are like building block which is used to control HTML view
OR it is the building blocks of angular application, the main job
@Component = it is used to convert typescript class to angular component

@NgModule = it is used to convert typescript/javascript class into angular module

Service = The main purpose of the service is to reusability instead of writing a functionality inside a component,
seperating into aservice will make itusable inother component as well 

pipes => pipes allow us to transform the data before displaying it in the view

interpolation = bind data from ts file html 

Modules = An angular building blocks

Just-In-Time compiler
== when we ask employee class agin and again then technically it will create object again and again 
bt JIT will provide already created object
Directive = it is the instructions in DOM which is used to specify component and business logic
it is used to pass messaged from component to service and service to component
Note:
Angular application starts from Index.html, if create one component and done will all functionality in this component and 
if you want to reflect it on your application then you need to place your selector name in index.html page

subscribe = it is used to extract data one by one, if u store data in response then it will save data as objects, bt u subscribe then it will as json format

STEPS:
1)ng new hello-world = it used to create new project.
2)ng-serve = it is used to start application
3) ng g c (componentName)=== used to generate component
4) ng g interface (interfaceName) === used to generate interface
5) ng g service (serviceName)
6) after creating service then copy service class and paste it in app.module.ts inside provides and also import from servoce
7) you need to have HttpClientModule,
you can place it inside appmodule.ts inside imports

{} => means u are fetching
[] => means setting tag attribute
STEPS HOW ANGULAR WORKS

employee.ts => employee.service.ts => employee.component.ts => html

step01= create interface file
step02 = 

diff module and component?
ans = module is like a package, In package we have class(component)
what is Angular CLI?
ans = Angular CLI is a great tool to create and work with Angular Applications.

What is the difference between ngOnInit and constructor?
Constructor initializes class members. 
ngOnInit() is a place to put the code that we need to execute at very first as soon as the class is instantiated
