Ways to push code in Repository

git init                                       = used to initialized                     
git add -A                                     = it is used to add all files
git commit -m 'Added my project'               = used to commit
git remote add origin [gitHub URL Repository]  = used to add in perticular Repository
git push -u -f origin master/main                   = used to push code in branch

remote = means git provide cloud storage
-f = The -f flag stands for force. This will automatically overwrite everything in the remote director
-u = The -u flag sets the remote origin as the default. This lets you later easily just do git push and 
     git pull without having to specifying an origin since we always want GitHub in this case.
